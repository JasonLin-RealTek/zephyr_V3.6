    description: |
      Enter 4-Byte Addressing value from JESD216 BFP DW16

      This property is ignored if the device is configured to use SFDP data
      from the sfdp-bfp property (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_DEVICETREE) or to read
      SFDP properties at runtime (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_RUNTIME).

      For CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_MINIMAL this is the 8-bit value from bits 31:24
      of DW16 identifying ways a device can be placed into 4-byte addressing
      mode.  If provided as a non-zero value the driver assumes that 4-byte
      addressing is require to access the full address range, and
      automatically puts the device into 4-byte address mode when the device
      is initialized.
